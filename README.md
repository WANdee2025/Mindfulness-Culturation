Breaking the infinite loops of the Continuities.

# Continuity Breaker

A minimalist digital experiment designed to visualize the flow of conditioned states and the transformative power of a conscious "Break."

## The Philosophy

In the digital age, our minds are often caught in an endless loop of data, memories, and projections—a stream of **Continuity**. This project implements the core logic of observation and interruption.

- **The Flow**: Life moves forward through a non-stop `setInterval`. Inputs arise and pile up, creating a sense of burden.
- **The Break**: Interaction is the act of mindfulness. By breaking the continuity, the user experiences a deliberate "Void"—a state of stillness where no new inputs are processed.
- **The Cycle**: Stillness is a temporary refuge. Nature eventually resumes its course, inviting the user to practice awareness again and again.

## Features

- **Non-Stop Arising**: Automated generation of mental/sensory data points.
- **Interactive Interruption**: Click any state to trigger the `Continuity Breaker`.
- **The 5-Second Void**: An intentional pause that clears the entire interface to simulate a state of stillness.
- **Minimalist UI**: A dark-mode, terminal-inspired aesthetic focusing only on what is essential.

## Technical Implementation

- **Language**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+).
- **Engine**: `setInterval` and `setTimeout` orchestration.
- **State Management**: Zero-dependency DOM manipulation to reflect the "Arising" and "Vanishing" of elements.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Observe the `STREAMING CONTINUITY`.
3. When the mind (or the screen) feels cluttered, click any entry to activate the **Continuity Breaker**.
4. Experience 5 seconds of `STILLNESS` before the flow resumes.
